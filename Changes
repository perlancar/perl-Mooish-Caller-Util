Revision history for Mooish-Caller-Util

0.06    2015-07-30 (PERLANCAR)

	- Add another detection check for Moo: sometimes Moo uses
	  Method::Generate::Constructor instead of
	  Method::Generate::BuildAll.

	- Be safer when skipping frame with Mouse & older perl (make sure
	  we're skipping eval frame).


0.05    2015-07-27 (PERLANCAR)

	- Add workaround for perl < 5.14 (apparently there is an extra eval
	  frame with Mouse and these older perls) [CT].


0.04    2015-07-27 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Make sure we test with Moo >= 2.000002 (which guarantees to call
	  BUILDARGS).

	- [test] Show Mo/Moo/Moose/Mouse version.

	- [doc] Fix typo in example.


0.03    2015-07-26 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Downgrade TestRequires to Mo/Moo/Moose/Mouse to TestRecommends,
	  to reduce deps.


0.02    2015-07-26 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Reduce startup overhead (Carp, feature, ...) by removing usage of
	  experimental.


0.01    2015-07-26 (PERLANCAR)

        - First release.
